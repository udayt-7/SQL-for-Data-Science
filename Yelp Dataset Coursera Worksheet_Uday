Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
	####################################
	SELECT COUNT(*)
		FROM table
	####################################

i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table =  10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table =  10000
x. tip table =  10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

	####################################
	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(key))
		FROM table
	####################################


i. Business =  id: 10000
ii. Hours = business_id: 1562
iii. Category = business_id: 2643
iv. Attribute = business_id: 1115
v. Review = id:10000, business_id: 8090
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 10000
viii. Tip =  user_id:537, business_id:3979
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = user_id: 11
xi. Elite_years =2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer: 

	########################################################################

	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name(user) 
	WHERE column_name(id/name/review..../compliment_photos) IS NULL

	########################################################################

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	####################################
	SELECT AVG(column)
		FROM table
	####################################


	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:1		max:5		avg:3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:1	max:5		avg:3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:0		max:2		avg:0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:1		max:53		avg:1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count

		+------------------------+--------+--------------+
		


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	Not necessarily, reviews has some impact on fans but its the yelping_since(visiting since)
	along with good reviews will together contribute to higher fan count.
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	########################################################################

	SELECT id, name, review_count, fans, yelping_since
	FROM user
	ORDER BY fans DESC

	########################################################################
	

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: LOVE = 1780
			HATE = 232.

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	########################################################################
	
	SELECT COUNT(*)	
	FROM review		
	WHERE text LIKE "%love%"; ----> 1789

	SELECT COUNT(*)	
	FROM review		
	WHERE text LIKE "%hate%"; ----> 232

	########################################################################

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. 
Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.


i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

	**I didnt understand this part.**

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

		Both groups have almost same number of reviews:
		35 reviews are in 2-3 star rated group
		31 reviews are in 4-5 star rated group

		Surprisingly Starbucks is rated less (2.5) in Montreal!

         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

		Yes, All Businesses are from same neighborhood (Ville-Marie) except for one business Café Rose de Lima. 
		But the postal codes vary for most places even though they are nearby.
		I think Ville-Marie is a prime destination in Montreal and more hence more yelp locations.

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or 
anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, 
and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, 
so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do: 

I would like to compare the review count and average star ratings city wise.

         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
          
      First I need the City names, review count and star rating.
      The process is simple but interesting.
      Three main questions will be answered:
      	Which city has the most review counts and their avg rating
      	Which business has the best average rating with 100 + reviews.
      	To find the busineess with least average rating consisting of 100 and above reviews

                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:


1.To find average rating of cities with most review counts    

As expected Las Vegas has the highest review counts, surprisingly for 80000+ reviews the average rating is 3.7
This tells that Las Vegas is a place with really good yelp locations.

Scottsdale has the best review_count:Average_stars ratio in the shown 25 rows with 20000+ reviews and nearly 4 star rating.

2. To find the busineess with best average rating consisting of 100 and above reviews

Around 7 yelp places have the privilege of getting 4.5 star rating in yelp. All of them are from different cities.
Please note that places are considered with 100+ reviews only.
There might be best rated places than these, but if 100+ people agree then the reviews can be apt and collectively considered.
